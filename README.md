# **Credit Card Fraud Detection üö®**  

## **Overview**  
This project focuses on building an efficient fraud detection system for credit card transactions using various machine learning models. To address the highly imbalanced nature of fraud detection data, we employed multiple balancing techniques and evaluated the performance of each model to determine the optimal solution.

## **Data Balancing Techniques ‚öñÔ∏è**  
Given the challenge of class imbalance (fraud cases are rare), we utilized the following techniques to create balanced datasets:  
1. **Undersampling**  
2. **Oversampling**  
3. **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**  
4. **ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)**  

For each balanced dataset, we built and compared several machine learning models:  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **Decision Tree**  
- **XGBoost**

## **Model Evaluation and Selection üèÜ**  
- **Undersampling**: While models trained on undersampled data performed well, valuable data was discarded, leading to a potential loss of information. Therefore, these models are not ideal for production use.  
- **SMOTE and ADASYN**: Models trained using these techniques showed consistently good performance.  

### **Best Performing Model**  
- **Logistic Regression** emerged as the most effective and practical model:  
   - ROC-AUC: **0.99** (Training), **0.97** (Testing)  
   - High **Recall** ensures fraudulent transactions are detected effectively.  
   - **Resource-Efficient**: Compared to complex models like Random Forest and XGBoost, Logistic Regression is computationally light and easy to interpret.  

Given its simplicity, interpretability, and minimal resource requirements, Logistic Regression with **SMOTE** is the recommended solution.

## **Cost-Benefit Analysis üí∞**  
When selecting a model for deployment, we considered:  
1. **Resource and Infrastructure Requirements**:  
   - Complex models like **XGBoost**, **Random Forest**, or **SVM** require heavy computational power and increase deployment costs.  
   - **Logistic Regression**, in contrast, is cost-effective, making it suitable for organizations with limited resources.  

2. **Impact of Precision vs. Recall**:  
   - **Small Transaction Value**: High **Precision** is critical to avoid unnecessary false positives and reduce manual verification efforts.  
   - **Large Transaction Value**: High **Recall** is prioritized to ensure that high-value fraudulent transactions are not missed, mitigating significant financial losses.

## **Key Insights üîç**  
1. **Logistic Regression** with SMOTE achieves a **high ROC-AUC score** and superior **Recall**, making it ideal for fraud detection.  
2. The simplicity of **Logistic Regression** reduces costs and computational overhead, making it practical for real-world deployment.  
3. For smaller transaction values, focus on **Precision** to minimize false positives and manual intervention.  
4. For larger transaction values, prioritize **Recall** to detect high-value fraudulent cases effectively.  
5. **Undersampling techniques** compromise on data quality and are not suitable for fraud detection systems.

## **Conclusion üìù**  
By leveraging data balancing techniques and evaluating multiple machine learning models, we recommend **Logistic Regression with SMOTE** for credit card fraud detection. This model strikes the perfect balance between performance, simplicity, and cost efficiency, making it ideal for both small and large-scale financial institutions.
